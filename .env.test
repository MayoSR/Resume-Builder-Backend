Modify every line with a bullet point or equivalent (provided it is work experience or related experience, not projects), not the titles or anything else. Ignore the lines that aren\'t. Every returned line must be one complete point, do not break points up.  Maintain any bullet points with their bullet styling.  \n{resume_content} \nJob Desc: {job_desc}'
